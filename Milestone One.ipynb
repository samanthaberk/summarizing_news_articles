       " {'(CNN)George Zimmerman -- acquitted by a Florida jury over the death of Trayvon Martin -- was arrested in Florida on suspicion of aggravated assault and domestic violence with a weapon, local authorities said.  The 31-year-old Florida resident was arrested Friday by police in Lake Mary at about 10 p.m. and booked into the John E. Polk Correctional Facility, according to that facility\\'s website. That facility, like its website, is run by the Seminole County Sheriff\\'s Office.  It all came about after Zimmerman allegedly threw a wine bottle at a girlfriend, his lawyer Don West told reporters.  \"Whatever happened took place several days ago,\" said West. \"And, as far as I know, they have not been together for some time, certainly not since then.\"  Police first learned about it after coming \"in contact with the (alleged) victim at a traffic stop\" on Monday, Lake Mary police spokeswoman Bianca Gillett  said.  When asked about the delay in making the arrest, Gillett said the arresting officer tried to reach Zimmerman on Monday and Tuesday, but couldn\\'t, and was off-duty Wednesday and Thursday. It was the officer\\'s decision not to pass off the case to another officer, Gillett said.  The incident is the latest legal run-in for Zimmerman since his acquittal in July 2013 on a murder charge in the death of Martin, a 17-year-old African-American. In fact, it\\'s his second arrest for alleged domestic violence against a girlfriend -- though Lake Mary police spokeswoman Bianca Gillett said this alleged \"victim is not the same (woman) as in 2013.\"  \"It\\'s clear he hasn\\'t been very lucky with the ladies the last few months,\" West said of his client.  Judge bars contact, orders weapons surrendered  Zimmerman appeared Saturday morning before Judge John Galluzo, who decided to bar him from contacting the alleged victim or going into Volusia County. He was also told to surrender any weapons to a relative or third party, but not to stop drinking since the judge said \"there wasn\\'t any allegation of abuse of alcohol in the arrest affidavit.\"  Appearing in court is not new for Zimmerman, who became a national figure in 2012 after spotting Martin in his Sanford, Florida, neighborhood. The two ended up having a confrontation that climaxed with Zimmerman fatally shooting the teenager, who was unarmed.  That incident, and authorities\\' decision not to immediately charge Zimmerman, spurred large-scale protests. In April of that year, Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder, with an affidavit accusing him of profiling Martin and ignoring a police dispatcher\\'s request that he wait for police.  After a high-profile trial, a jury found Zimmerman not guilty.  That made him a free man -- but did not end his issues with the law.  No charge after other domestic violence claim  About two weeks after the verdict, he was pulled over for speeding in northern Texas. Much bigger troubles came in November 2013, when Zimmerman was taken into custody at his then-girlfriend\\'s Apoka, Florida, home after the two allegedly had a heated fight.  He was arrested then on aggravated assault and misdemeanor counts of domestic violence battery and criminal mischief, accusations that he denied. He posted $9,000 bail days later.  But after the girlfriend asked that the issue be dropped, State Attorney Phil Archer announced that prosecutors would not press charges.  More recently, in September 2014, Lake Mary police said that a man claimed that Zimmerman threatened him during a road rage incident. \"I will ... kill you,\" Zimmerman allegedly said, according to police. \"Do you know who I am?\" He was not arrested and has not been charged.  West said that his client -- who posted $5,000 bail later Saturday -- doesn\\'t have a full-time job, implying he\\'s had his struggles since the Martin acquittal.  \"It\\'s been a devastating experience that he\\'s had that he\\'s working through,\" the lawyer said. \"... I\\'m concerned, obviously, as we are here again this morning.\"  CNN\\'s Christine Sever and Chris Welch contributed to this report.

       " {\"(CNN) -- Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored his third goal in as many games to continue his return to form and lift Barcelona to the top of Spain's La Liga on Saturday night.  The Sweden striker, who was criticized after his scoring streak dried up in the first two months of this year, netted the only goal against fourth-placed Mallorca to put the defending champions three points clear of Real Madrid.  Real can return to the summit on goal difference with victory in Sunday's Madrid derby against Atletico.  Mallorca had won 12 of 13 matches at home this season, and should have taken the lead in the second minute when Aritz Aduriz smashed a shot against the post.  Barcelona started with top scorer Lionel Messi and playmaker Xavi on the bench, while ahead of Wednesday's Champions League quarterfinal at English club Arsenal, while Thierry Henry and Gerard Pique were also rested.  The European champions had a goal disallowed in the 12th minute when young winger Pedro Rodriguez was ruled to be offside.  Mallorca keeper Dudu Aouate then denied Gabriel Milito and Ibrahimovic, and the islanders hit the post again just before halftime from Borja Valero's free-kick.  Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola brought on Messi for Andres Iniesta seven minutes after the break, and Xavi replaced Yaya Toure around the hour mark.  The move worked as Ibrahimovic pounced to score his 15th goal this season from close range in the 63rd minute after Pepe Luis Marti deflected Xavi's corner at his own goalkeeper, and Aouate could only manage a reflex block.  Aouate did well to tip over a fierce Messi drive, and the in-form Argentina forward -- named the world's highest-earning player during the week -- should have doubled Barcelona's lead but surprisingly fired well over the bar.  The Catalans then played out for time to clinch a 26th clean sheet this season for goalkeeper Victor Valdes.  Mallorca can lose fourth place if Sevilla win at Villarreal on Sunday.  Third-placed Valencia remained six points ahead of Mallorca after losing 3-0 to struggling Real Zaragoza in Saturday's late match.

Norman Borlaug received a Congressional Gold Medal from then President George W. Bush on July 17, 2007.  Borlaug died from cancer complications in Dallas, Texas, a spokeswoman for Texas A&M University said.  A 1970 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, Borlaug was a distinguished professor of international agriculture at the university.  Borlaug started at Texas A&M in 1984, after working as a scientist in a program that introduced scientific techniques for preventing famine in Mexico, according to the university.  Until recently, he traveled worldwide working for improvements in agricultural science and food policy, said Kathleen Phillips, a university spokeswoman.

       " {'(CNN)Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal on Monday stood by his criticism of so-called \"no-go\" zones in Europe, where sovereign nations allegedly cede authority to Muslim immigrants, a controversial idea that many critics say is overblown.  And the potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate decried what he called immigrants\\' insistence on \"non-assimilation, the fact that \"you\\'ve got people who want to come to our country but not adopt our values,\" which he called \"dangerous.\"  Jindal has the reputation of policy wonk among Republicans and boldly told GOP officials during a 2013 address to the Republican National Committee that they \"must stop being the stupid party\" and needed to \"stop insulting the intelligence of voters.\"  Asked by CNN\\'s Wolf Blitzer whether he would walk back his comments on no-go zones, made in a speech to the Henry Jackson Society in London earlier that day, Jindal said, \"not at all.\"  MSNBC guest won\\'t apologize for Jindal remark  \"And I\\'m also making a bigger and maybe even more controversial point that radical Islam is a grave threat, we need Muslim leaders to denounce the individuals, not just the acts of violence,\" he said, adding that \"it is absolutely correct to insist on assimilation\" of immigrants in the United States.  But pressed for specific examples of such no-go zones, Jindal demurred, saying he had met with \"elected officials and others\" to discuss them and noted a report in UK tabloid the Daily Mail that purported to highlight the challenges facing law enforcement in such areas.  \"I knew by speaking the truth we were gonna make people upset,\" Jindal told Blitzer.  Jindal was also unable to offer examples during an earlier interview with CNN\\'s Max Foster, saying that he\\'s \"heard from folks here that there are neighborhoods where women don\\'t feel comfortable going in without veils ... We all know that there are neighborhoods where police are less likely to go into.\"  \"I think that the radical Left absolutely wants to pretend like this problem is not here. Pretending it\\'s not here won\\'t make it go away,\" he told Foster.  Pressed for details, Jindal said only, \"I think your viewers know absolutely there are places where the police are less likely to go.\"  And asked whether that feeling may be caused by high crime rates, rather than the Muslim population in the area, Jindal said, \"This isn\\'t a question.\"  \"I know the Left wants to make this into an attack on religion and that\\'s not what this is. What we are saying, it\\'s absolutely an issue for the UK, absolutely is an issue for America and other European and Western nations,\" he said.  During his London speech, Jindal said, \"In the West, non-assimilationist Muslims establish enclaves and carry out as much of Sharia law as they can without regard for the laws of the democratic countries which provided them a new home,\" according to prepared remarks.  \"It is startling to think that any country would allow, even unofficially, for a so-called \\'no-go zone.\\' The idea that a free country would allow for specific areas of its country to operate in an autonomous way that is not free and is in direct opposition to its laws is hard to fathom,\" he said.  Jindal also suggested the rise of such no-go zones has contributed to growing anti-Semitism throughout Europe, which has prompted many Jews to emigrate from their home countries.  \"How does such evil rise again in democratic countries?\" Jindal asked. \"I believe it is because radical Islamists have been given too wide a berth to establish their own nation within a nation,\" he said.  Muslim leaders need to \"condemn anyone who commits these acts of violence, and clearly state that these people are evil and are enemies of Islam,\" he added.  The idea of \"no-go zones\" sparked controversy last week when a Fox News commentator raised the prospect of areas in France, Britain, Sweden and Germany where those countries\\' governments \"don\\'t exercise any sovereignty,\" and which instead are run largely by Muslim immigrants.  The commentator also mentioned whole cities \"where non-Muslims simply don\\'t go in,\" in particular the city of Birmingham in the United Kingdom.  British Prime Minister David Cameron later pushed back on the idea, calling the commentator \"a complete idiot.\"  \"When I heard this, frankly, I choked on my porridge and I thought it must be April Fools\\' Day. This guy is clearly a complete idiot,\" he said.  The Fox commentator later apologized to Birmingham for labeling it a no-go zone, but stood by the idea that such areas exist. Fox News, however, issued a formal apology for the remarks, with host Julie Banderas retracting the comments as \"regrettable errors\" and saying the network \"deeply regret(s) the errors and apologize(s) to any and all who may have taken offense.\"  CNNMoney: Fox News apologizes 4 times for inaccurate comments about Muslims in Europe  But a Jindal aide said the governor stuck largely to the text as prepared, which included the criticism of the zones. And the remarks have drawn praise from conservatives and attacted national media attention at a time when the potential presidential contender is looking to raise his profile in time for a White House bid.  National Review columnist Larry Kudlow called it a \"brilliant take on radical Islam.\"  \"It is the toughest speech I have read on the whole issue of Islamic radicalism and its destructive, murdering, barbarous ways which are upsetting the entire world,\" Kudlow wrote in an op-ed.

      "[{'At the start of a big week for the Higgs boson, the most sought-after particle in all of physics, scientists in Illinois said Monday that they had crept closer to proving that the particle exists but had been unable to reach a definitive conclusion.  The scientists outlined their final analysis based on more than 10 years of research and 500 trillion particle collisions using the U.S. Department of Energy\\'s Fermilab Tevatron collider near Batavia, Illinois, whose budgetary woes shut it down last year.  What is the Higgs boson and why is it important?  Their announcement came two days before researchers at the Large Hadron Collider under the Alps are due to unveil their latest results at an eagerly awaited seminar at the CERN particle physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland.  \"Our data strongly point toward the existence of the Higgs boson,\" Rob Roser, a spokesman for one of two independent experiments at the Tevatron, said in a statement. \"But it will take results from the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider in Europe to establish a discovery.\"  Read more: The woman at the edge of physics  Finding the Higgs boson would help explain the origin of mass, one of the open questions in physicists\\' current understanding of the way the universe works.  The particle has been so difficult to pin down that the physicist Leon Lederman reportedly wanted to call his book \"The Goddamn Particle.\" But he truncated that epithet to \"The God Particle,\" which may have helped elevate the particle\\'s allure in popular culture.  More science news from CNN Light Years  The results from the Tevatron, stemming from the two different experiments, suggest that if the Higgs boson does exist, it would have a mass between 115 and 135 GeV -- about 130 times the mass of the proton.  Before the Tevatron closed, the experiments there sent beams of particles whizzing around a four-mile circumference in opposite directions. Traveling at a fraction below the speed of light, the particles would crash into each other, creating conditions similar to those at the dawn of the universe for scientists to observe.  But so far, neither the results from the U.S. collider experiments nor from the the Large Hadron Collider, located 328 feet underneath the border of France and Switzerland, have enough statistical significance to constitute a discovery.  \"It is easier to look for a friend\\'s face in a sports stadium filled with 100,000 people than to search for a Higgs-like event among trillions of collisions,\" said Luciano Ristori, a physicist at the U.S. facility.  Attention now turns to the latest analysis of data from the $10 billion European machine, the world\\'s most powerful particle smasher.  \"We now have more than double the data we had last year,\" Sergio Bertolucci, the director for research and computing at CERN, said last month. \"That should be enough to see whether the trends we were seeing in the 2011 data are still there, or whether they\\'ve gone away. It\\'s a very exciting time.\"  Scientists getting clearer picture of \\'God particle\\'  ': ['U.S.-based scientists say their data points toward the existence of the Higgs boson', 'Finding the Higgs boson would help explain the origin of mass', \"But the research at the Tevatron collider doesn't provide a conclusive answer\", 'Attention now turns to a seminar Wednesday on data from the Large Hadron Collider']}, {'(CNN)George Zimmerman -- acquitted by a Florida jury over the death of Trayvon Martin -- was arrested in Florida on suspicion of aggravated assault and domestic violence with a weapon, local authorities said.  The 31-year-old Florida resident was arrested Friday by police in Lake Mary at about 10 p.m. and booked into the John E. Polk Correctional Facility, according to that facility\\'s website. That facility, like its website, is run by the Seminole County Sheriff\\'s Office.  It all came about after Zimmerman allegedly threw a wine bottle at a girlfriend, his lawyer Don West told reporters.  \"Whatever happened took place several days ago,\" said West. \"And, as far as I know, they have not been together for some time, certainly not since then.\"  Police first learned about it after coming \"in contact with the (alleged) victim at a traffic stop\" on Monday, Lake Mary police spokeswoman Bianca Gillett  said.  When asked about the delay in making the arrest, Gillett said the arresting officer tried to reach Zimmerman on Monday and Tuesday, but couldn\\'t, and was off-duty Wednesday and Thursday. It was the officer\\'s decision not to pass off the case to another officer, Gillett said.  The incident is the latest legal run-in for Zimmerman since his acquittal in July 2013 on a murder charge in the death of Martin, a 17-year-old African-American. In fact, it\\'s his second arrest for alleged domestic violence against a girlfriend -- though Lake Mary police spokeswoman Bianca Gillett said this alleged \"victim is not the same (woman) as in 2013.\"  \"It\\'s clear he hasn\\'t been very lucky with the ladies the last few months,\" West said of his client.  Judge bars contact, orders weapons surrendered  Zimmerman appeared Saturday morning before Judge John Galluzo, who decided to bar him from contacting the alleged victim or going into Volusia County. He was also told to surrender any weapons to a relative or third party, but not to stop drinking since the judge said \"there wasn\\'t any allegation of abuse of alcohol in the arrest affidavit.\"  Appearing in court is not new for Zimmerman, who became a national figure in 2012 after spotting Martin in his Sanford, Florida, neighborhood. The two ended up having a confrontation that climaxed with Zimmerman fatally shooting the teenager, who was unarmed.  That incident, and authorities\\' decision not to immediately charge Zimmerman, spurred large-scale protests. In April of that year, Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder, with an affidavit accusing him of profiling Martin and ignoring a police dispatcher\\'s request that he wait for police.  After a high-profile trial, a jury found Zimmerman not guilty.  That made him a free man -- but did not end his issues with the law.  No charge after other domestic violence claim  About two weeks after the verdict, he was pulled over for speeding in northern Texas. Much bigger troubles came in November 2013, when Zimmerman was taken into custody at his then-girlfriend\\'s Apoka, Florida, home after the two allegedly had a heated fight.  He was arrested then on aggravated assault and misdemeanor counts of domestic violence battery and criminal mischief, accusations that he denied. He posted $9,000 bail days later.  But after the girlfriend asked that the issue be dropped, State Attorney Phil Archer announced that prosecutors would not press charges.  More recently, in September 2014, Lake Mary police said that a man claimed that Zimmerman threatened him during a road rage incident. \"I will ... kill you,\" Zimmerman allegedly said, according to police. \"Do you know who I am?\" He was not arrested and has not been charged.  West said that his client -- who posted $5,000 bail later Saturday -- doesn\\'t have a full-time job, implying he\\'s had his struggles since the Martin acquittal.  \"It\\'s been a devastating experience that he\\'s had that he\\'s working through,\" the lawyer said. \"... I\\'m concerned, obviously, as we are here again this morning.\"  CNN\\'s Christine Sever and Chris Welch contributed to this report.  ': ['Zimmerman posts $5,000 bail; he was accused of throwing a bottle at a girlfriend', '\"He hasn\\'t been very lucky with the ladies,\" attorney says of Zimmerman', \"He became a national figure after being charged, then acquitted in Trayvon Martin's death\"]}, {\"(CNN) -- Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored his third goal in as many games to continue his return to form and lift Barcelona to the top of Spain's La Liga on Saturday night.  The Sweden striker, who was criticized after his scoring streak dried up in the first two months of this year, netted the only goal against fourth-placed Mallorca to put the defending champions three points clear of Real Madrid.  Real can return to the summit on goal difference with victory in Sunday's Madrid derby against Atletico.  Mallorca had won 12 of 13 matches at home this season, and should have taken the lead in the second minute when Aritz Aduriz smashed a shot against the post.  Barcelona started with top scorer Lionel Messi and playmaker Xavi on the bench, while ahead of Wednesday's Champions League quarterfinal at English club Arsenal, while Thierry Henry and Gerard Pique were also rested.  The European champions had a goal disallowed in the 12th minute when young winger Pedro Rodriguez was ruled to be offside.  Mallorca keeper Dudu Aouate then denied Gabriel Milito and Ibrahimovic, and the islanders hit the post again just before halftime from Borja Valero's free-kick.  Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola brought on Messi for Andres Iniesta seven minutes after the break, and Xavi replaced Yaya Toure around the hour mark.  The move worked as Ibrahimovic pounced to score his 15th goal this season from close range in the 63rd minute after Pepe Luis Marti deflected Xavi's corner at his own goalkeeper, and Aouate could only manage a reflex block.  Aouate did well to tip over a fierce Messi drive, and the in-form Argentina forward -- named the world's highest-earning player during the week -- should have doubled Barcelona's lead but surprisingly fired well over the bar.  The Catalans then played out for time to clinch a 26th clean sheet this season for goalkeeper Victor Valdes.  Mallorca can lose fourth place if Sevilla win at Villarreal on Sunday.  Third-placed Valencia remained six points ahead of Mallorca after losing 3-0 to struggling Real Zaragoza in Saturday's late match.  Valencia went behind four minutes before halftime to a thunderous left-foot shot from Uruguayan defender Diogo, and were reduced to 10 men just before the break when Nikola Zigic received a second yellow card.
